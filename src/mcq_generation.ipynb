      " ICS Cybersecurity  Fundamentals In part one, we will briefly recap the first edition of the book to outline what was covered  and to point out the content that is still very relevant and that will be built upon in this  second edition. The remainder of part one will be dedicated to discussions around a  revised IDMZ architecture, resulting from many deployments, experience in the field,  practice, and feedback. Part one will conclude with a deep dive into how to design for  security, architecture that allows all the tools, techniques, and activities discussed in the  rest of the book to be implemented effectively and easily. This section comprises the following chapters: *\t  Chapter 1 ,  Introduction and Recap of the First Edition *\t  Chapter 2 ,  A Modern Look at the Industrial Control System Architecture *\t  Chapter 3, The Industrial Demilitarized Zone *\t  Chapter 4, Designing the ICS Architecture with Security in Mind 1 Introduction and  Recap of First  Edition Welcome to the second edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . Over the next 24 chapters, we  will discuss the next logical steps after building a secure  Industrial Control System  ( ICS )  environment and defining a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and standards,  discussed in detail in the first edition.  We are going to start off this second edition with a brief recap of topics and material  that were covered in the first edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . This has mainly been  added to get you up to speed with the terminologies, technologies, and principles that are  expanded upon throughout the rest of this book. The remainder of the book concentrates  on security monitoring and verification of the ICS security posture and the various tools,  techniques, and activities involved.\n"

      "  In order for all these topics to be effectively implemented within your own organization, we will  start with a high-level overview and analysis of an Industrial Control System (ICS)  architecture that is designed from the ground up in compliance with security principles as outlined by  ISO/IEC TR15443:2018 , the ISA/ISA99 standards, NIST SP-800-82 Revision 2, and other similar guidelines. Our goal is to provide you a solid foundation upon which all  security activities can be performed more easily in your organization. The main sections of this first chapter are as follows: *\t  1. Introduction *\t   2. A Modern Look at the Industrial Control System Architecture (ICS) *\t   3. The Industrial Demilitarized Zone (IDMZ)*  •   Note that while there is a great deal of variation in how ICSs are deployed, it has been our experience that most architectures exhibit certain common characteristics and design patterns regardless of vendor or system type. A large portion of this section will cover the basic principles underlying modern industrial  control systems architecture , which we believe apply to almost all deployments. Our aim is not just to discuss a few examples, but also to present an architecture that reflects many experiences and insights gained over years of working in ICS environments . To make it easier for you to relate what we will be covering to your own organization, Figure 1 shows the high-level diagram depicting the relationship between our proposed architecture model , ISO/IEC TR15443:2018 , and other similar security guidelines. This figure represents a simple yet comprehensive ICS architecture that can serve as an excellent starting point for implementing security measures .  Figure 1 The high-level Industrial Control System Architecture (ICS) diagram based on the proposed IDMZ model.

Designing the ICS Architecture with Security in Mind The security of an industrial control system is largely determined by its architecture . There are a number of design patterns and best practices that can be followed to ensure you achieve your desired level of security . The key factors that should always come into play when considering new deployments or modifications, especially those involving critical infrastructure elements such as electricity generation , transportation systems , water treatment plants  , etc. are: *  1. How will the system perform in a secure state ? This means how does it behave once it is properly configured and protected by security controls ? In our opinion, this question should be at the top of your priority list when considering changes to any ICS architecture . If you can answer \"yes\" to these questions: * Is the environment adequately segmented (e.g., demilitarized zones ) such that each component only interacts with components it needs to function properly?  * Do all system interactions happen in a controlled manner using standard mechanisms like VPNs, firewalls, and similar controls ? This will help ensure proper monitoring can occur without disruption or interference from malicious parties . It also ensures that critical infrastructure elements (e.g., control networks ) are isolated from less secure systems such as business applications , network management devices , etc.. * Is it easy for an administrator to understand what is happening in the system ?  For example, can you view real-time events on a dashboard without having access privileges beyond those assigned by your role or position within your organization? If so then this means there are no hidden back doors where someone could go undetected because they know how everything works internally . Furthermore , if administrators have strong knowledge about their roles and responsibilities as well as general awareness regarding security controls implemented across all layers of an ICS ecosystem (e.g., firewalls ) then implementing additional policies like two factor authentication becomes much simpler since users already know what they should do when prompted by such mechanisms . It is also important that any changes made within your environment are documented properly so administrators can easily identify how things were configured prior to implementation which allows them quickly revert back if needed without having guesswork involved during troubleshooting procedures later on downstream after an issue has occurred due solely because something wasn't done according 2\n",

      "  1 Introduction and  Recap of First  Edition Welcome to the second edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . Over the next 24 chapters, we  will discuss the next logical steps after building a secure  Industrial Control System  ( ICS )  environment and defining a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and standards,  discussed in detail in the first edition.  We are going to start off this second edition with a brief recap of topics and material  that were covered in the first edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . This has mainly been  added to get you up to speed with the terminologies, technologies, and principles that are  expanded upon throughout the rest of this book. The remainder of the book concentrates  on security monitoring and verification of the ICS security posture and the various tools,  techniques, and activities involved. 4     Introduction and Recap of First Edition This chapter will be a review of the first edition of this book. We will go over all the topics  and material that were covered in the first edition, which should give you a solid base for  the topics covered in this book. The chapter will conclude with an explanation of what to  expect in the rest of this second-edition book.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics: *\t What is an ICS? *\t  Information Technology  ( IT ) and  Operational Technology  ( OT ) convergence and  the associated benefits and risks *\t The comprehensive risk management process  *\t The  Defense-in-Depth  ( DiD ) model  *\t ICS security program development   Industrial Cybersecurity - second edition The way I am positioning the first and second editions of  Industrial Cybersecurity  is with  the first edition focusing on ICS cybersecurity fundamentals and ICS cybersecurity  program design and implementation. The second edition should be a logical addition  by taking these core concepts and expanding upon them with tools, techniques, and  activities that are aimed at verifying, monitoring, checking, improving, and correcting the  overall security posture of the ICS environment. Some topics we will be covering on this  continued journey include the following: *\t Architecture design with security in mind *\t Active and passive security monitoring *\t Industrial threat intelligence *\t Visualizing, correlating, and alerting ( Security Information and Event  Management  ( SIEM )) *\t Incident response activities *\t Security assessments (penetration testing, red/blue team exercises) *\t Threat-hunting exercises As mentioned earlier, this book will expand upon the topics of the first edition, so let's  first recap on what we covered back in 2017.\n"

Recap of the first edition     5 Recap of the first edition If you have not yet read the first edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity , now would be the time  to do so. It covers in detail how to get from zero to hero on implementing an industrial  cybersecurity program, to define a secure ICS environment and network architecture that  fits your organization's needs and requirements. Reading the first edition is not a requirement though, as the first four chapters of this  book will recap on relevant topics and get you on track to follow along and understand the  material presented in this second edition. Without further ado, let's start our journey with a recap of ICS (cybersecurity) principles  and practices. What is an ICS? The traffic lights on your way to work if you go by car; the collision avoidance system if  you take the train or metro; the delivery of electricity that powers the light you use to \n",
      " read this book; the processing and packaging that went into creating the jug of milk in  your fridge or the coffee grind for that cup of Joe that fuels your day... What all these  things have in common is the ICS driving the measurements, decisions, corrections,  and other miscellaneous actions that result in the end products and services we take for  granted each day. Strictly speaking, an ICS is a collection of equipment, devices, and communication  methods that, when combined for the foundational system, perform a specific task, \n",
      " deliver a service, or create a particular product.  Figure 1.1  shows an ICS architecture,  spanning the various layers of functionality as described in the Purdue model \n",
